# Risks

- A workflow-only scaffold can drift into paperwork if dispatch scripts do not keep producing real code or validation outputs.
- Topic-scoped tenancy needs careful naming and ownership boundaries to avoid accidental policy leakage.
- OPA-only is the correct starting topology, but fast-changing data may later require bundle/discovery improvements or OPAL-like capabilities.
- Release automation exists locally, but GitHub push/release execution still depends on remote repo creation and permissions.
